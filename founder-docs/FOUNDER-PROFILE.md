### The Founder Journey: Building the New World

**2023-Present: Piedra Azul Ecosystem**

Started with individual projects, realized they're all connected:
- Inner Ascend (spiritual app, 65% completion rate)
- Mazunte Connect (500+ users, 4.8/5 rating)

**The Realization:** These aren't separate projects - they're **one operating system for the new world**

## The Vision: Piedra Azul Ecosystem

### What I'm Building

**15 interconnected projects** creating the infrastructure for regenerative living:

**Core Projects:**
1. **LIFE OS** - The mothership. AI operating system integrating everything.
2. **Global Ecovillage Network** - Own an NFT, live anywhere. Decentralized living.
3. **Community AI Platform** - Smart ecovillage infrastructure + formation support.

**Supporting Projects:**
4. Inner Ascend (personal growth)
5. Proyecto Salvaje (land DAO)
6. Community App (social network for hubs)
7. Token Economy (local currencies)
8. Local Marketplace (alternatives to Airbnb/Amazon)
9. Education Programs (for all ages)
10. Spiritual Retreat Center (medicine work, healing)
11. Tech Platform (engineering services)
12. AI Consultancy (ethical AI for conscious businesses)
13. App Development Agency (vision to reality)
14. Facilitator Certification (training conscious leaders)
15. Physical Infrastructure (land ownership models)

### The Thesis

The old system is failing:
- Blackrock's "own nothing and be happy"
- Social credit scores
- Cash deletion (CBDCs)
- Corporate control of everything

**We're building the alternative:**
- Collective ownership (Web3 + co-ops)
- Our own platforms and economies
- Regenerative communities worldwide
- Freedom and sovereignty

**This is for our children.** The bridge to the new world.
