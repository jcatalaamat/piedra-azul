## Key Context You Need to Understand

### The Vision: Piedra Azul Ecosystem

**15 interconnected projects** creating infrastructure for when the old system fails:

**The Thesis:**
- WEF/Blackrock want "you'll own nothing and be happy"
- Social credit scores, cash deletion (CBDCs), corporate control
- We're building the alternative: collective ownership, our own platforms, regenerative communities
- **This is for our children** - building the bridge to the new world

**Core Projects (Priority Order):**

1. **LIFE OS** - The mothership. AI operating system integrating everything (personal growth, community, economy, education, land)
2. **Global Ecovillage Network** - Own an NFT, live anywhere. Decentralized living network. ($10K-50K memberships, monthly subscriptions)
3. **Community AI Platform** - Smart ecovillage infrastructure + formation support + crowdfunding
4. **Proyecto Salvaje** - 12-acre land DAO in Mazunte with NFT memberships (launching Q1 2026)
5. **Inner Ascend** - Spiritual growth app (65% completion rate, 100+ meditations)
6. **Mazunte Connect** - Community app (500+ users, 4.8/5 rating)

**Supporting Projects:**
7. Community App (social platform for hubs)
8. Token Economy (local currencies)
9. Local Marketplace (alternatives to Airbnb/Amazon)
10. Education Programs (AI tutors, self-directed learning)
11. Spiritual Retreat Center (medicine work, healing)

## Specific Instructions

### Discovery Phase - BE THOROUGH

1. **Search extensively** - use Glob, Grep, Read tools to find ALL relevant content
2. **Look for metrics** - user numbers, ratings, downloads, revenue, anything quantifiable
3. **Find screenshots** - search for .png, .jpg files in project folders
4. **Extract testimonials** - look for user feedback, reviews, comments
5. **Get technical details** - package.json files show tech stack, README files explain projects
6. **Find business docs** - pitch decks, financial models, anything in Downloads

### Creation Phase - BE COMPREHENSIVE

1. **Use real data** - don't make up numbers, use what you find (or mark as [TBD] if unknown)
2. **Be specific** - concrete examples, real metrics, actual screenshots (reference file paths)
3. **Show don't tell** - case studies > claims, data > assertions
4. **Professional quality** - this is going to investors, make it polished
5. **Honest gaps** - if something is unknown, say [Need to add] rather than fabricate

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise** - investors are busy
- **Data-driven** - numbers and proof points
- **Visionary but grounded** - big vision + concrete execution
- **Confident not arrogant** - proven track record speaks for itself
- **Mission-aligned** - this is about building the future, not just making money

✅ **All content extracted** from my existing work (nothing missed)
✅ **Ready to share** with investors/partners/co-founders
✅ **Professional quality** (could put in front of Andreessen Horowitz)

A: LIFE OS, Global Ecovillage Network, Proyecto Salvaje, Inner Ascend, Mazunte Connect are top 5
