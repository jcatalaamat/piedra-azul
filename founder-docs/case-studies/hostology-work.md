- **Role:** Led product development, engineering team, infrastructure migration
- **Timeline:** Oct 2023 - Jan 2025 (15 months)
- **Key Achievement:** 40% cost reduction, 3x performance improvement, 35% retention increase

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. AWS Infrastructure Migration
- **Challenge:** Expensive legacy hosting, poor performance, technical debt
- **Solution:** Architected and executed complete AWS migration
- **Results:**
  - 40% hosting cost reduction (tens of thousands saved annually)
  - 3x performance improvement (faster page loads, API responses)
  - Zero downtime migration (planned and executed perfectly)
  - Scalable infrastructure for future growth

**Technical Details:**
- Migrated from legacy hosting to AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFront)
- Implemented auto-scaling for traffic spikes
- Database optimization (query performance, indexing)
- CDN for static assets (CloudFront)
- Monitoring and alerting (CloudWatch)

### 2. Technical Leadership
- **Team:** Led 5 engineers (mix of senior and junior)
- **Processes:** Established coding standards, code review processes, agile rituals
- **Results:**
  - Quality metrics improved 60% (fewer bugs, better code)
  - Team velocity increased 30%
  - Junior engineers mentored and grown
  - High team satisfaction and retention

**Leadership Approach:**
- Collaborative, not dictatorial
- Mentorship and teaching (pair programming, code reviews)
- Psychological safety (okay to make mistakes, learn together)
- Clear expectations and feedback

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Challenge:** Manual deployments taking 2 hours, risky, infrequent
- **Solution:** Built automated deployment pipeline
- **Results:**
  - Release time: 2 hours → 15 minutes (8x faster)
  - Daily deployments enabled (vs weekly)
  - Automated testing (catch bugs before production)
  - Rollback capability (safety net)

**Technical Details:**
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Staging environment (test before production)
- Blue-green deployments (zero downtime)

### 4. Full-Stack Development
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript (complex UIs for event management)
- **Backend:** Node.js, C# ASP.NET (API development, business logic)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (schema design, query optimization)
- **API:** GraphQL (efficient data fetching)
- **Scale:** 50,000+ monthly API requests, 500+ venues

**Features Shipped:**
- Event creation and management workflows
- Venue analytics dashboards
- Real-time notifications
- Payment processing integrations
- Multi-tenant architecture improvements

### 5. Product Strategy
- **Collaboration:** Worked with stakeholders (product, sales, customers)
- **Prioritization:** Balanced technical debt vs new features
- **User Research:** Analyzed usage data, talked to customers
- **Results:**
  - 12+ major features shipped
  - User retention improved 35%
  - Customer satisfaction increased
  - Revenue-driving features delivered on time

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Full-Stack:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, C# ASP.NET, PostgreSQL, GraphQL
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudFront, VPC)
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, monitoring
- **Leadership:** Team management, mentoring, process improvement
- **Product:** Roadmap planning, stakeholder management, user research

## Key Learnings

**1. Infrastructure Matters**
- Bad infrastructure kills products (slow = users leave)
- Cost optimization doesn't mean compromise (performance AND savings)
- Monitoring essential (can't improve what you don't measure)

**2. Leadership is About People**
- Technical skills matter, but empathy matters more
- High-performing teams need psychological safety
- Mentorship creates multipliers (1 senior → 5 capable engineers)

**3. Process Enables Speed**
- Good processes (code review, CI/CD, testing) increase velocity long-term
- Short-term slowdown for long-term speed
- Discipline creates freedom

**4. Balance Matters**
- Technical debt vs new features (70/30 or 80/20 rule)
- Perfect vs good enough (ship and iterate)
- Business needs vs engineering ideals (pragmatic compromise)

## Why This Matters for Piedra Azul
