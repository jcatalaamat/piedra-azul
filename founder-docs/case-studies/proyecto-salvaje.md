# Case Study: Proyecto Salvaje

**First Land-Backed ReFi DAO in Latin America**

## Overview
- **Problem:** Regenerative communities struggle to acquire land, raise capital, govern transparently
- **Solution:** 12-acre land DAO in Mazunte with NFT memberships, transparent governance, dual-token economy
- **Results:** Land secured, website live in 5 languages, NFT launch Q1 2026, $2M+ raise potential
- **Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Arbitrum, Solidity smart contracts

## Asset & Model
- **Real Asset:** 12 acres (48,562m²) of titled land in Mazunte, Oaxaca
- **Value:** ~$55K per 2,000m² plot
- **Model:** NFT memberships (Founding Steward $85K, Land Partner $55K, Community $250-500)
- **Governance:** DAO with on-chain voting, multi-sig treasury, transparent financials

## Technical Implementation
- **Website:** React + Vite + Tailwind, 5 languages (EN, ES, FR, CA, DE)
- **Blockchain:** Arbitrum One (L2 for low fees)
- **NFTs:** ERC-1155 standard for multiple tiers
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, audited, governance integration
- **Token Economy:** TIERRA (governance) + SEEDS (utility)

## Market Validation
- Strong interest from conscious community
- NFT ownership model understood (Web3 adoption growing)
- Real asset backing builds trust (not just digital)
- DAO governance aligns incentives
- First-mover in Latin America ReFi space

## Revenue Projections
- Year 1: $2M+ in NFT sales (non-dilutive capital)
- Ongoing: $200K+/year in amenity fees, event hosting, retreat revenue
- Land appreciation: $500K-1M+ over 5 years

## Learnings
1. Real asset backing critical for trust (land you can visit)
2. Multi-language dramatically increases reach (5 languages = 5x audience)
3. Hybrid traditional/Web3 best for adoption (not crypto-only)
4. Transparent governance documentation essential (people read everything)
5. Community formation is hard - 90% fail in 5 years (need support)

## Integration with Piedra Azul
- **First hub** for Global Ecovillage Network
- **Proof of concept** for DAO + land model
- **Capital generator** ($2M+ non-dilutive from NFT sales)
- **Retreat center** location for medicine work and programs
- **Living lab** for Community AI Platform intelligence
