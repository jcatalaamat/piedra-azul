# Global Ecovillage Network

**Own an NFT. Live anywhere. Raise your family free.**

A decentralized network of regenerative communities where one membership gives you access to live, work, and raise families across the entire global network.

---

## The Vision

While Blackrock and the WEF want you to "own nothing and be happy," we're building the opposite:

**Collective ownership. Radical freedom. Regenerative living. Anywhere in the world.**

### What Is This?

A global network of ecovillages, regenerative communities, and conscious living spaces where:

‚ú® **One membership = access to the entire network**
üåç **Live and work from any location worldwide**
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Raise your children in regenerative, community environments**
üé´ **NFT passport or traditional membership - your choice**
üè° **Collective ownership through Web3 and co-ops**
üí∞ **Predictable costs, no hidden fees**
üå± **Regenerative land, sustainable living, conscious culture**
üöÄ **Digital nomad lifestyle meets intentional community**

### The Problem We're Solving

**Traditional Life:**
- Trapped in one location by mortgage/rent
- Isolated nuclear families raising kids alone
- Extractive landlords and property systems
- "Own nothing" rental economy controlled by corporations
- Kids raised in urban concrete away from nature
- No community, no support, no freedom

**Traditional Ecovillages:**
- Expensive buy-in ($100K-500K+)
- Locked into one location
- Can't travel or work remotely
- Often aging demographic, not family-focused
- Siloed, not networked
- Hard to access

**Our Solution:**
- Affordable NFT/membership model ($10K-50K one-time OR $300-800/month)
- Live in any hub in the network
- Bring your remote work, stay as long as you want
- Raise kids in regenerative communities with support
- Travel freely between locations
- Multi-generational, family-focused communities
- Web3 ownership OR traditional membership - both welcome
- Decentralized, community-governed

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have $10K-50K upfront?**
A: We offer monthly subscription options starting at $300/month. No large upfront cost, just monthly payments. Cancel anytime after 3 months.

**Q: Can I bring my kids?**
A: Absolutely! This is designed for families. Family units and children's programs are core to our model.

**Q: What if I'm not into crypto/Web3?**
A: No problem! Traditional membership with credit card payments gets you the exact same access and benefits. Crypto is optional.

**Q: How long can I stay at each location?**
A: As long as you want, subject to availability. We recommend booking 30 days ahead. Most members stay 1-3 months per location.

**Q: What if a hub is full when I want to visit?**
A: Higher-tier members get priority booking. We're building enough capacity that this shouldn't be a problem. Worst case, try another hub or wait a bit.

**Q: Can I rent out my membership?**
A: No. Memberships are non-transferable except through resale of the NFT. We're a community, not an Airbnb.

**Q: What about healthcare, visas, etc.?**
A: You're responsible for your own healthcare, travel insurance, and visa requirements. We provide resources and guidance but can't manage this for you.

**Q: Is this a cult?**
A: No. This is a membership network, not a religion or ideology. Come and go as you please. We value sovereignty and freedom.

**Q: What if the project fails?**
A: NFTs are resellable on secondary markets. Co-op members can vote to liquidate assets. We're structured to minimize risk and maximize member protection.

**Q: Can I start my own hub?**
A: Yes! We'll have a replication toolkit and partnership model. You run your hub, we provide the network and platform. Revenue sharing applies.

**Q: Is there a refund policy?**
A: NFTs can be resold on open markets (we don't control that). Subscription members can cancel anytime. Traditional memberships: contact us.
