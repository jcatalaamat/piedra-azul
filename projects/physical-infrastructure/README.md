# Physical Infrastructure

Land acquisition, community spaces, and physical hub development.

## Purpose

Create and manage physical spaces that:
- Support collective living and governance
- Provide venues for programs and gatherings
- Demonstrate regenerative building practices
- Generate sustainable revenue for the community
- Serve as replicable models for other hubs

## Components

### Land Ownership Models

Exploring options:
- Community land trust
- Cooperative ownership
- Fractional ownership via tokens/NFTs
- Long-term leases
- Partnership with existing landowners

**Key Questions:**
- What legal structure protects long-term community access?
- How do members invest and what rights do they get?
- What happens when members leave?
- How to prevent speculation and gentrification?

### Community Spaces

Essential infrastructure:
- Communal kitchen and dining
- Meeting and workshop spaces
- Coworking areas
- Meditation and yoga spaces
- Gardens and food production
- Accommodation (various types)
- Common areas and social spaces

### Regenerative Design

Building principles:
- Natural and local materials
- Passive cooling and climate design
- Solar and renewable energy
- Water catchment and greywater systems
- Composting toilets and waste management
- Food forests and permaculture
- Biodiversity enhancement

### Pilot Hub: Mazunte

Initial focus:
- [ ] Map existing spaces (Rancho Salvaje, Amakura, etc.)
- [ ] Identify partnership opportunities
- [ ] Assess land availability
- [ ] Research legal requirements
- [ ] Develop financial model
- [ ] Create community governance structure

### Revenue Streams

- Program fees and retreats
- Accommodation for visitors
- Event space rentals
- Coworking memberships
- Food and beverage services
- Educational tours
- Consultation for other hubs

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Network Existing Hubs
Connect and collaborate with current spaces without new construction

### Phase 2: Secure Community Space
Acquire or lease land/buildings for core community functions

### Phase 3: Build Infrastructure
Develop facilities for programs, accommodation, and community life

### Phase 4: Expand & Replicate
Document model and support new hubs in other locations

## Financial Considerations

- Member rights and responsibilities
- Conflict resolution
- Long-term stewardship
- Inclusion and accessibility

## Success Metrics

- Community satisfaction with spaces
