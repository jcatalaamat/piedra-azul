# Token Economy

A cashless token system enabling circular economy within community hubs and across the global network.

## Purpose

Create a local currency that:
- Keeps economic value within communities
- Rewards community participation
- Enables frictionless transactions
- Connects multiple hubs in one ecosystem
- Provides alternative to traditional banking

## Key Questions

### Economics
- How are tokens created and distributed initially?
- What backs the token value?
- How do local businesses convert tokens to fiat if needed?
- What prevents inflation or deflation?
- How does token flow between different hubs?

### Business Model
- How do businesses accumulate tokens and profit?
- What incentives encourage token adoption?
- Are there transaction fees? Who benefits?
- How does the system sustain itself?

### Technology
- Blockchain-based or centralized database?
- NFT integration for unique assets/memberships?
- Wallet infrastructure
- Security and fraud prevention

## Potential Token Uses

### Earn Tokens
- Volunteering hours
- Contributing to projects
- Teaching workshops

- Supporting community projects

### Business Integration
- Restaurants and cafes
- Accommodations (alternative to Airbnb)
- Transportation (alternative to Uber)
- Holistic practitioners
- Local artisans
- Tour operators
