# Piedra Azul

A global network of interconnected spiritual hubs and ecovillages integrating community living, education, technology, and regenerative practices.

## What is Piedra Azul?

- **Collective community living** with shared land ownership
- **Educational programs** for digital nomads, regenerative practices, and life skills
- **Token-based local economy** connecting services, businesses, and community members
- **Community platform** for projects, crowdfunding, volunteering, and programs
