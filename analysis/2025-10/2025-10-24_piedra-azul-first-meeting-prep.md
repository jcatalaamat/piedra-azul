**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Purpose:** Introduce myself, show what I've built, express interest in building the future together

## My Core Message

**"I do tech, I'm working on Mazunte Connect, and I want to build the future with you."**

## What I Bring to the Table

### 1. Real Technical Execution

**Live Products I've Built:**
- **Mazunte Connect** - 500+ users, 4.8/5 rating, the community app everyone uses here
- **Inner Ascend** - Spiritual transformation app with 100+ meditations, 65% completion rate
- **Proyecto Salvaje** - Land DAO platform (12 acres in Mazunte, NFT memberships launching Q1 2026)
- 4 other live platforms serving thousands of users

**What This Proves:**
- I don't just talk - I ship products that people actually use
- I understand this community (Mazunte, digital nomads, conscious living)
- I can build beautiful, functional apps quickly

### 2. Full-Stack Technical Skills

**I Can Build Everything:**
- Mobile apps (React Native - iOS & Android)
- Web platforms (React, Next.js)
- Backend systems (Node.js, Supabase, PostgreSQL)

**10+ Years Experience:**
- Former CTO at Tinto (10K+ users)
- Senior Engineer at Hostology (40% cost reduction, 3x performance improvement)

- Led teams of 5-15 engineers

### 3. Understanding of the Vision

**I Get What Piedra Azul is Trying to Do:**
- Building regenerative communities and alternative systems
- Connecting digital nomads, conscious seekers, and land projects
- Creating community ownership vs corporate extraction
- Integrating technology, community, land, and personal growth

**My Work Aligns Perfectly:**
- Mazunte Connect = community platform foundation
- Proyecto Salvaje = land + DAO governance
- Inner Ascend = personal transformation
- All pieces of the same ecosystem you're building

## What I Want to Build Together

### Immediate Value I Can Provide

**Community Platform Evolution:**
- Take Mazunte Connect and scale it

- Integrate with land projects and retreat centers

**Technical Infrastructure:**

- Create AI tools for community intelligence
- Implement token economy (TIERRA)
- DAO governance systems

**Speed to Market:**
- I work fast - Mazunte Connect took 3 months to 500 users
- I know the tech stack inside and out
- I understand the users (I'm part of this community)

### Long-Term Vision Alignment

**I Want to Build:**
- LIFE OS - AI operating system for human flourishing
- Global Ecovillage Network - own an NFT, live anywhere
- Community AI Platform - intelligence for regenerative communities
- The complete ecosystem for the new world

**This is NOT a job or contract - this is my life's work.**

## My Opening

**Short Version (30 seconds):**

"Hey, I'm Jordi. I built Mazunte Connect - the app a lot of people here use for events and finding services. I'm a senior full-stack engineer with 10 years experience, and I've built 7 live products serving thousands of users. I'm really aligned with what you're building with Piedra Azul - regenerative communities, conscious tech, alternative systems. I don't just want to build apps for you - I want to build the future with you. I think there's a real opportunity to collaborate."

**Longer Version (2-3 minutes):**

"I'm Jordi - you might know me from Mazunte Connect, the community app I built that's now being used by 500+ people here. But that's just one of seven live products I've shipped. I also built Inner Ascend, a spiritual transformation app with 100+ meditations, and Proyecto Salvaje, which is the first land-backed DAO in Latin America with 12 acres right here in Mazunte.

I've been a full-stack engineer for 10+ years - former CTO, led teams at tech companies in London, worked on everything from mobile apps to blockchain to AI. I can build the whole stack - mobile, web, backend, infrastructure, Web3, all of it.

But what really drew me to want to talk to you is that I'm not just a developer. I'm building the same vision you are - an ecosystem that connects personal growth, community living, regenerative land projects, and conscious technology. I've got 500+ hours of facilitation training, I've done deep shadow work and medicine integration, I understand this world from the inside.

When I look at Piedra Azul, I see exactly what I've been trying to build. And I think we could do something really special together. I'm not looking for a job or a contract - I'm looking for partners to build the future with. So I wanted to meet you, understand what you're working on, and explore how we might collaborate."

## What to Listen For

**Red Flags:**
- Just looking for cheap development work

- Excited about Mazunte Connect integration
- Long-term thinking (5-10 years+)
- Good team chemistry and values alignment

---

## My Non-Negotiables

### I Will NOT:
1. Work as just a contractor/employee (I need ownership/equity)
2. Build someone else's vision without co-creation
3. Compromise on technical quality or ethical standards
4. Rush or cut corners to meet arbitrary deadlines
5. Give up ownership of my existing projects without fair value

### I WILL:
1. Bring my full technical and strategic expertise
2. Move fast and ship high-quality products
3. Be a true partner in building the vision
4. Contribute existing projects to the ecosystem if there's fair equity
5. Commit for the long haul (decades, not months)
6. Build with consciousness, not just code

## Possible Outcomes

### Best Case:
- We align perfectly on vision and values
- They want a technical co-founder/CTO
- Fair equity split (10-30%)
- I bring Mazunte Connect, Proyecto Salvaje, Inner Ascend into the ecosystem
- We combine forces and build something massive together

### Good Case:
- Strong alignment, but they need to think about structure
- Start with a collaboration on Mazunte Connect integration
- Prove we work well together
- Move toward deeper partnership over time

### Neutral Case:
- Interesting conversation, but not the right fit right now
- Stay in touch, watch how they develop
- Maybe collaborate on specific projects
- No hard feelings, just timing or structure doesn't align

### Worst Case:
- They just want to hire a developer, not a co-founder
- Vision doesn't actually align
- Team or values don't feel right
- I politely decline and continue building my own ecosystem

## After the Meeting

**Follow-Up Actions:**
1. Send thank you email within 24 hours
2. Share relevant materials (Mazunte Connect case study, portfolio, etc.)
3. If interested, propose next steps (deeper dive meeting, technical demo, partnership proposal)
4. Document the conversation in analysis folder
5. Update co-founder search or partnership strategy based on learnings

**Questions to Reflect On:**
- Does this feel like the right partnership?
- Do I trust these people?
- Is the vision alignment real or surface-level?
- What would I need to feel 100% committed?
- What are the risks and rewards?
