## How to Approach Local Investors

### The Strategy

**1. Start with Warm Intros (Easiest):**
- Ask Mazunte Connect users: "Who should I talk to about investing?"
- Event organizers know everyone - ask them
- Business owners know other business owners
- Get introduced, don't cold message

**2. Prove Value First:**
- Offer to list their business for free
- Show them the app and traction (500 users!)
- Get them using it
- THEN ask if they want to invest

**3. Group Pitch Events:**
- Organize "Mazunte Connect Investor Evening"
- Invite 10-20 potential investors
- Show app, share vision, make pitch
- Individual follow-ups after
- Do this in Mazunte, Zipolite, Puerto Escondido

**4. One-on-One Coffee Meetings:**
- "I'm the founder of Mazunte Connect. Can I buy you coffee and show you what we're building?"
- 20-minute demo + pitch
- Ask for investment or intro to others

### The Script

**Initial Outreach (via WhatsApp/FB):**

"Hi [Name], I'm Jordi - I built Mazunte Connect, the community app. We now have 500+ users and I'm adding booking/payments so we can compete with Airbnb and Rappi but keep the money in our community.

I'm raising a small round from local investors who care about Mazunte staying authentic. Would you be open to a quick coffee so I can show you what we're building?

Either way, would love any intros to people who might be interested in supporting local alternatives to extractive platforms."

**In the Meeting:**

1. **Show the app** (people are using it!)
2. **Show the problem** (Airbnb/Rappi extracting millions)
3. **Show the solution** (all-in-one, fair fees, community-owned)
4. **Show the numbers** (realistic revenue projections)
5. **Make the ask** ($10K-50K for X% equity)

**Close:**
"I'm raising $100K-250K from people who love Mazunte and want to build the alternative. Interested in being part of it?"
