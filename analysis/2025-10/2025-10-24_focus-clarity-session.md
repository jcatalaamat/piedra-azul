## Current State

**Status:** Founder package complete, seeking co-founder & capital

**Key Question:** What to focus on next?

## Strategic Priorities (from PRIORITY-MATRIX.md)

### Tier 1: Primary Focus
1. **LIFE OS** (Score: 71) - AI-powered personal operating system
2. **Global Ecovillage Network** (Score: 72) - NFT-based living network
3. **Community AI Platform** (Score: 60) - B2B intelligence for communities

### Tier 2: Active Development
4. **Proyecto Salvaje** (Score: 60) - First hub, NFT launch Q1 2026
5. **Inner Ascend** (Score: 59) - Spiritual growth app, content engine
6. **Token Economy** (Score: 54) - Economic integration layer

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fundraising ($500K-1M seed)
- [ ] Finalize pitch deck
- [ ] Investor outreach list
- [ ] 10 investor meetings/week target
- [ ] Warm intro strategy

### 2. Co-founder Search

- [ ] Reach out to network
- [ ] 5 co-founder coffee chats/week

### 3. LIFE OS MVP Development

## Resource Allocation (Next 6 Months)

- **Fundraising:** 40%
- **LIFE OS planning/building:** 30%
- **Co-founder search:** 20%
- **Services (cash flow):** 10%

## Key Decisions

1. **Focus on 2-3 projects** (LIFE OS + Global Ecovillage + Community AI)
2. **Wait on 12 other projects** until capital/team in place
3. **Services = cash flow only**, not primary focus
4. **Proyecto Salvaje** runs on autopilot (website done, launch in Q1)

## Risks & Blockers

- Spreading too thin across 15 projects
- Fundraising takes longer than expected
- Building LIFE OS without technical co-founder
- Running out of runway before seed close

## Success Metrics (Next 3 Months)

- [ ] $500K+ seed committed
- [ ] Co-founder identified and committed
- [ ] LIFE OS MVP in development (team hired)
- [ ] Proyecto Salvaje 20+ memberships pre-sold
- [ ] 10+ warm investor intros
