# Piedra Azul Partnership Strategy - Updated

**Date:** October 24, 2025

## Who is Piedra Azul?

**Reality Check - They're NOT what I thought:**

Piedra Azul is a **regenerative farm/ranch** near Mazunte (El Zapotal), NOT a retreat center or hotel.

**What they actually do:**
- Regenerative agriculture (permaculture, agroforestry, soil health)
- Organic farm products (eggs, chicken, fruits, vegetables, buffalo dairy, compost)
- Weekly deliveries to Mazunte (Tuesday, Friday, Sunday)
- Volunteering/educational programs (teach regenerative farming)
- Farm tours and visits
- Started by a couple in 2021 who fell in love with Oaxaca

**Their mission:**
"Nature has all the solutions - we just need patience and intention to find them"
- Build self-sustaining systems
- No external inputs when possible
- Community education and connection
- Most nutritious food possible

## What to Build WITH Piedra Azul

### Priority #1: Farm Product Delivery (Build First)

**Why Start Here:**
1. They already deliver 3x/week (proven logistics)
2. Clear customer demand (people want organic products)
3. Higher margins than restaurant delivery (20-30% vs 15-20%)
4. Recurring orders (weekly subscriptions)
5. Differentiates you from Rappi (they don't have this)

**Features:**

- Weekly subscription model (standing orders every week)
- One-time purchases
- Delivery scheduling (Tu/Fri/Sun routes)
- Payment processing

**Revenue Model:**
